# what is this file
A guide to the shell folder and mostly tips and fixes for bugs and other stuff my system I have to deal with.

# What is this shell folder and how does it work?
first off we have "[config folder]/shprofile"
this file is not in the shell folder I forget why but it loads all the files in the shell folder.

The first one to be loaded is "[config folder]/shell/shalias"
this file loads all the aliases its quite self explanitory.

After loading the last one this file is loaded "[config folder]/shell/shex"
it exporteds all the environment veriables to fix problems, add stuff to path or force programs to follow xdg desktop standards.

Lastly we have "[config folder]/shell/shfunc"
it loads funcutions that I can't be asked to make into script files also most of these i haven't used in a very long time.
